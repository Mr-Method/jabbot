Jabbot2 Protocol

A functional bot outputs all the informations to STDOUT, the outputted
information is then processed by the agent.

A functional bot MUST accept these command arguments , then output the
corresponding information:

    cmd whoru
	echo $BOT_NAME $BOT_VERSION

    cmd trigger
	echo bot's trigger string.

    cmd gvars
	echo a lists of variables that need to be globally stored.

    cmd reset
	Tell the bot to reset itself.

    cmd reload
	Tell the bot to reload the databases.

And this is for sending messages to the functional bot:

    message
	NO OTHER ARGUMENTS. The message could be read from the
	functional bot's STDIN. The format of message is defined in
	MessageSpec.txt.
