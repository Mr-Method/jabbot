###  README --- jabbot/experiments/CorpseSimilarity/

Given any two text files, determine their similaritiy.

Method 1: Bigram frequency vector dot product

Principle: If two corpse has similar bigram distribution, they
are similar to each other.

 similarity :: range 0..1
 similarity :=bfv(a) dot bfv(2)

 bfv :: bigram vector of all possible bigrams in unicode character set.
 bfv := ordered normalized bigram
